# XIOT-Embedded-Systems-task
Hello :)
-There are two files :
the first one which called "design.DSN "
the protues file contains the schematic through which we will
test the system (code).
the sceond one which called Myproject contains code of our system
-the code is wrriten in c language using Mickroc IDE
-in directives feel free to change the ports in case u have your own design
-As i don't have any knowledge about "Arduino" i used Microcontrorrler PIC's Family in testing the system speacially
"PIC16F877A"
-the code is delivered by comments to clarify the idea
